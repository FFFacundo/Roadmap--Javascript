# Data Types
It refers to the type of data that a variable can or will hold. In Javascript there are 7 primitive data types:
- string
- number
- boolean
- bigint
- null
- undefined
- Symbol

Objects are non-primitives.
In JS, we can put any type in a variable, since it can for example hold a string and later store a number, since its a dynamic and weakly typed language.
