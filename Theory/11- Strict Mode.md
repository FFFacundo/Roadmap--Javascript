# Strict Mode
Strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, which helps catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions. It is enabled by adding `'use strict';` at the beginning of a script or function. In strict mode, certain actions that are normally allowed will throw errors, making it easier to write secure and reliable code.

Strict mode prevents or throws errors for unsafe actions such as assigning to undeclared variables, deleting undeletable properties, or duplicating parameter names. It also disables some features that are considered problematic or confusing. Using strict mode is recommended for all modern JavaScript code to help avoid subtle bugs and improve code quality.
