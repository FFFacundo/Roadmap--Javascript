# Memory Management
Memory management is the process of allocating and freeing memory in a program. JavaScript handles most memory management automatically, but understanding it helps write efficient and leak-free code. Poor memory management can lead to memory leaks and performance issues.

## Memory Lifecycle
Memory is allocated when variables and objects are created and freed when they are no longer needed. Proper management ensures efficient use of resources. Developers should be aware of object references and avoid holding onto data longer than necessary.

## Garbage Collection
The process by which JavaScript automatically frees memory that is no longer referenced by the program. Modern engines use algorithms like mark-and-sweep to detect and clean up unused memory. Understanding garbage collection helps you write code that is both efficient and reliable.
