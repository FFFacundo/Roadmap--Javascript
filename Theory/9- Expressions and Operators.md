# Expressions and Operators
Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that produce a result. Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands, allowing you to manipulate data and control logic. Mastering expressions and operators is essential for writing effective and concise JavaScript code.

## Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables (e.g., `=`, `+=`, `-=`). They are used to store results and update variable values. Compound assignment operators combine an operation with assignment, such as `x += 2` (equivalent to `x = x + 2`).

## Comparison Operators
Compare two values and return a boolean (e.g., `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`, `<`). Used in conditional statements and loops. Comparison operators are fundamental for decision-making in code.

## Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`). They work with numbers and can be used for calculations, increments, and decrements. The `**` operator is used for exponentiation.

## Bitwise Operators
Operate on binary representations of numbers (e.g., `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`). Useful for low-level operations, such as manipulating individual bits in numbers.

## Logical Operators
Combine or invert boolean values (e.g., `&&`, `||`, `!`). Essential for control flow and conditions. Logical operators are often used in conjunction with comparison operators.

## BigInt Operators
Operators that work with BigInt values, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `**`, allowing operations on very large integers. BigInt enables safe arithmetic with numbers beyond the safe integer limit for regular numbers.

## String Operators
Operators that work with strings, mainly concatenation using `+` to join strings together. Template literals (using backticks) also allow for string interpolation.

## Conditional Operators
The ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`) selects one of two values based on a condition, providing a concise alternative to if...else. Useful for inline conditional assignments.

## Comma Operators
Evaluate multiple expressions and return the last one. Rarely used in practice, but can be useful in for loops or complex expressions.

## Unary Operators
Operate on a single operand (e.g., `typeof`, `!`, `++`, `--`). Unary operators can change the value or type of a variable, or check its type.

## Relational Operators
Compare the relationship between two values (e.g., `in`, `instanceof`). Used to check membership or type relationships, such as whether a property exists in an object or if an object is an instance of a class.
