# Iterators and Generators
Iterators are objects that allow sequential access to elements in a collection. They provide a standardized way to traverse data structures, such as arrays, maps, and sets. The iterator protocol defines how objects produce a sequence of values.

Generators are special functions that can pause and resume their execution, making it easier to work with iterators and implement custom iteration behavior. Generators are defined using the `function*` syntax and use the `yield` keyword to produce values one at a time. This allows for lazy evaluation and efficient handling of large or infinite sequences.
