# Javascript

Javascript, or JS, is a programming language that it is said to rule web applications. It is one of the core technologies of the World wide web. Sliders, alerts, popups and more are all built using this language. Furthermore, it is also used in non-browser environments as well, like Electron for desktop apps, React Native for mobile apps or Node.js for server-side code and even some DB such as MongoDB and CouchDB use JS as their scripting and query language.
Is is important to note that this language has almost nothing to do with Java, another programming language. The similar naming was pure marketing considerations.

### *Characteristics*

Javascript is a lightweight interpreted or "just-in-time compiled" programming language with first-class functions (this means that functions in this language are treated like any other variable, like being passed down as an argument, being returned by other function and assigned as a value to a variable). It is a **prototype-based***, **garbage-collected***, **dynamic*** language that supports multiple paradigms such as imperative, functional and object-oriented.

JS's dynamic capabilities include runtime obejct construction, variable parameter lists, functions variables, dynamic scripts creation (eval), object introspection(via for...in and Obejct utilities), and source-code recovery (retrieved through toString() ).

# TODO
Investigate more about JS dynamic capabilities  


***Prototype-based**: Is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined but derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or to an empty object. 
***Garbage-collection**: Process of finding and deleting objects which are no longer being referenced by other objects. It is a fundamental component of the memory management system used by JS 
***Dynamic languages**: (Or dynamically-typed languages) Are those where the interpreter assings variables a type at runtime based on the variable's current value.
