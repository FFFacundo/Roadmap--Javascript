# Classes
Classes are templates for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior and support inheritance. JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance and make it easier to create and manage objects.

Classes can have constructors, methods, and static properties. They support inheritance through the `extends` keyword, allowing you to create hierarchies of related objects. Classes make it easier to organize and reuse code, especially in large applications. You can also use getters, setters, and private fields to control access to class properties.
